-- Task: 
-- 5. [âžŠ 2.2] Given the following declarations:
signal a, b, c : std_ulogic;
type state_type is (idle, req, ack);
signal state : state_type;
-- indicate whether each of the following expressions is legal as a Boolean condition,
-- and if not, correct it:
a and not b and c                     -- a. 
a and not b and state = idle          -- b. 
a = '0' and b and state = idle        -- c. 
a = '1' and b = '0' and state = idle  -- d.
